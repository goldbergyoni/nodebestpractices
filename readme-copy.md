## **Welcome**

This repository summarizes and curates most of the knowledge gathered to date on Node.js best practices. It contains more than 53 quotes, code examples and diagrams from the highest ranked blog posts and StackOverflow threads.

# Project Setup Practices


## ☑ 1. Do something important 

**TL&DR:** Monitoring is a game of finding out issues before our customers do – obviously this should be assigned unprecedented importance. The market is overwhelmed with offers thus consider starting with defining the basic metrics you must follow (my sug

**Otherwise:** You end-up with a blackbox that is hard to reason about, then you start re-writing all logging statements to add additional information

## ☑ 2. Do other thing

# Code Style Practices


# Error Handling Practices

## ☑ Use async-await for async error handling

**TL;DR:** Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell (a.k.a the pyramid of doom). The best gift you can give to your code is using instead a reputable promise library or async-await which provides much compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch

**Otherwise:** Node.JS callback style, function(err, response), is a promising way to un-maintainable code due to the mix of error handling with casual code, excessive nesting and awkward coding patterns

| Item     | Value | Qty   |
| :------- | ----: | :---: |
| Computer | $1600 |  5    |
| Phone    | $12   |  12   |
| Pipe     | $1    |  234  |


### Definition Lists

**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for definition lists too:

Term 1
Term 2
:   Definition A
:   Definition B

Term 3

:   Definition C

:   Definition D

	> part of definition D


### Fenced code blocks

GitHub's fenced code blocks are also supported with **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting:

```
// Foo
var bar = 0;
```

> **Tip:** To use **Prettify** instead of **Highlight.js**, just configure the **Markdown Extra** extension in the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

> **Note:** You can find more information:

> - about **Prettify** syntax highlighting [here][5],
> - about **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting [here][6].


### Footnotes

You can create footnotes like this[^footnote].

  [^footnote]: Here is the *text* of the **footnote**.


### SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                  | ASCII                        | HTML              |
 ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------
| Single backticks | `'Isn't this fun?'`            | 'Isn't this fun?' |
| Quotes           | `"Isn't this fun?"`            | "Isn't this fun?" |
| Dashes           | `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash` | -- is en-dash, --- is em-dash |


### Table of contents

You can insert a table of contents using the marker `[TOC]`:

[TOC]


### MathJax

You can render *LaTeX* mathematical expressions using **MathJax**, as on [math.stackexchange.com][1]:

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

> **Tip:** To make sure mathematical expressions are rendered properly on your website, include **MathJax** into your template:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>
```

> **Note:** You can find more information about **LaTeX** mathematical expressions [here][4].


### UML diagrams

You can also render sequence diagrams like this:

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```

And flow charts like this:

```flow
st=>start: Start
e=>end
op=>operation: My Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```
