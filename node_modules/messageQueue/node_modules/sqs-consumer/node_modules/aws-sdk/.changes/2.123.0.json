If you attempt to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the deletion fails and the stack, including its status, remains unchanged. You can enable termination protection on a stack when you create it. Termination protection on stacks is disabled by default. After creation, you can set termination protection on a stack whose status is CREATE_COMPLETE, UPDATE_COMPLETE, or UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE."
