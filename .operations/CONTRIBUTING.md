## Contribution model

### Steering committee 🏆

Members of the steering committee work together to provide guidance and future direction to the project. Each committee member has a particular expertise which they share their knowledge on, and work to lead further improvements to the project in that area. The steering committee members are responsible for approving new best practices, and ensuring current best practices remain relevant.

### Collaborators 👍

Collaborators are members who are contributing to the repository on a regular basis, through suggesting new best practices, triaging issues, reviewing pull requests and more. Along with the steering committee, each collaborator leads a project tracked under our Github projects.

The role is in place to help the steering committee ensure that the content provided is of high standard, up-to-date with the industry, and available in many languages. Members who frequently participate in these activities will be invited to become a collaborator, based on the quality of their contributions.

The steering committee periodically reviews the collaborator list to identify inactive collaborators. Inactive collaborators can choose to either continue in or step down from their role, in which case they are acknowledged as a past collaborator. They may later request that the steering committee restore them to active status.
