# Operations Manual - Organizing and Maximizing Our Work
Building knowledge and a community by efficiently handling issues

## Handling issues and PRs

<br/>
In a nutshell, every issue and PR should get tagged by one of our core team and routed to the person who specializes in the related topic. This person then, will warmly welcome the contributor and then kick off the discussion (hopefully within 48 hours). The goal of each issue/PR is to learn new thing that might improve our repo and try to include the contributor in our army.

There is no specific person on call who assigns inquiries rather we count on our core team to visit almost everyday and assign issues/PR - this way, the workflow is not depend upon any specific person rather on our entire team.

Any new content should conform to our [writing guidelines](./writing-guidelines.md)

## Monthly maintenance

<br/>
Each month, a maintainer on call will open an issue for a maintenance work checklist and write down all the actions to perform by the end of the month (e.g. assign flower to a contributor). At the end of the month, that maintainer will perform the tasks on the checklist.
